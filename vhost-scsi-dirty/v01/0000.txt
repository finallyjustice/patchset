[PATCH 0/9] vhost-scsi: log write descriptors for live migration (and two bugfix)

The live migration with vhost-scsi has been enabled by QEMU commit
b3e89c941a85 ("vhost-scsi: Allow user to enable migration"), which
thoroughly explains the workflow that QEMU collaborates with vhost-scsi on
the live migration.

Although it logs dirty data for the used ring, it doesn't log any write
descriptor (VRING_DESC_F_WRITE).

In comparison, vhost-net logs write descriptors via vhost_log_write(). The
SPDK (vhost-user-scsi backend) also logs write descriptors via
vhost_log_req_desc().

As a result, there is likely data mismatch between memory and vhost-scsi
disk during the live migration.

1. Suppose there is high workload and high memory usage. Suppose some
systemd userspace pages are swapped out to the swap disk.

2. Upon request from systemd, the kernel reads some pages from the swap
disk to the memory via vhost-scsi.

3. Although those userspace pages' data are updated, they are not marked as
dirty by vhost-scsi (this is the bug). They are not going to migrate to the
target host during memory transfer iterations.

4. Suppose systemd doesn't write to those pages any longer. Those pages
never get the chance to be dirty or migrated any longer.

5. Once the guest VM is resumed on the target host, because of the lack of
those dirty pages' data, the systemd may run into abnormal status, i.e.,
there may be systemd segfault.

Log all write descriptors to fix the issue.

In addition, the patchset also fixes two bugs in vhost-scsi.

Dongli Zhang (log descriptor, suggested by Joao Martins):
  vhost: modify vhost_log_write() for broader users
  vhost-scsi: adjust vhost_scsi_get_desc() to log vring descriptors
  vhost-scsi: cache log buffer in I/O queue vhost_scsi_cmd
  vhost-scsi: log I/O queue write descriptors
  vhost-scsi: log control queue write descriptors
  vhost-scsi: log event queue write descriptors
  vhost: add WARNING if log_num is more than limit

Dongli Zhang (vhost-scsi bugfix):
  vhost-scsi: protect vq->log_used with vq->mutex
  vhost-scsi: Fix vhost_scsi_send_bad_target()
