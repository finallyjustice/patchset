[PATCH v8 0/7] target/i386/kvm/pmu: PMU Enhancement, Bugfix and Cleanup

This patchset addresses two bugs related to AMD PMU virtualization.

1. The third issue is that using "-cpu host,-pmu" does not disable AMD PMU
virtualization. When using "-cpu EPYC" or "-cpu host,-pmu", AMD PMU
virtualization remains enabled. On the VM's Linux side, you might still
see:

[    0.510611] Performance Events: Fam17h+ core perfctr, AMD PMU driver.

instead of:

[    0.596381] Performance Events: PMU not available due to virtualization, using software events only.
[    0.600972] NMI watchdog: Perf NMI watchdog permanently disabled

To address this, KVM_CAP_PMU_CAPABILITY is used to set KVM_PMU_CAP_DISABLE
when "-pmu" is configured.

2. The fourth issue is that unreclaimed performance events (after a QEMU
system_reset) in KVM may cause random, unwanted, or unknown NMIs to be
injected into the VM.

The AMD PMU registers are not reset during QEMU system_reset.

(1) If the VM is reset (e.g., via QEMU system_reset or VM kdump/kexec) while
running "perf top", the PMU registers are not disabled properly.

(2) Despite x86_cpu_reset() resetting many registers to zero, kvm_put_msrs()
does not handle AMD PMU registers, causing some PMU events to remain
enabled in KVM.

(3) The KVM kvm_pmc_speculative_in_use() function consistently returns true,
preventing the reclamation of these events. Consequently, the
kvm_pmc->perf_event remains active.

(4) After a reboot, the VM kernel may report the following error:

[    0.092011] Performance Events: Fam17h+ core perfctr, Broken BIOS detected, complain to your hardware vendor.
[    0.092023] [Firmware Bug]: the BIOS has corrupted hw-PMU resources (MSR c0010200 is 530076)

(5) In the worst case, the active kvm_pmc->perf_event may inject unknown
NMIs randomly into the VM kernel:

[...] Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 30 on CPU 0.

To resolve these issues, we propose resetting AMD PMU registers during the
VM reset process


Changed since v1:
  - Use feature_dependencies for CPUID_EXT3_PERFCORE and
    CPUID_8000_0022_EAX_PERFMON_V2.
  - Remove CPUID_EXT3_PERFCORE when !cpu->enable_pmu.
  - Pick kvm_arch_pre_create_vcpu() patch from Xiaoyao Li.
  - Use "-pmu" but not a global "pmu-cap-disabled" for KVM_PMU_CAP_DISABLE.
  - Also use sysfs kvm.enable_pmu=N to determine if PMU is supported.
  - Some changes to PMU register limit calculation.
Changed since v2:
  - Change has_pmu_cap to pmu_cap.
  - Use cpuid_find_entry() instead of cpu_x86_cpuid().
  - Rework the code flow of PATCH 07 related to kvm.enable_pmu=N following
    Zhao's suggestion.
  - Use object_property_get_int() to get CPU family.
  - Add support to Zhaoxin.
Changed since v3:
  - Re-base on top of Zhao's queued patch.
  - Use host_cpu_vendor_fms() from Zhao's patch.
  - Pick new version of kvm_arch_pre_create_vcpu() patch from Xiaoyao.
  - Re-split the cases into enable_pmu and !enable_pmu, following Zhao's
    suggestion.
  - Check AMD directly makes the "compat" rule clear.
  - Some changes on commit message and comment.
  - Bring back global static variable 'kvm_pmu_disabled' read from
    /sys/module/kvm/parameters/enable_pmu.
Changed since v4:
  - Re-base on top of most recent mainline QEMU.
  - Add more Reviewed-by.
  - All patches are reviewed.
Changed since v5:
  - Re-base on top of most recent mainline QEMU.
  - Remove patch "kvm: Introduce kvm_arch_pre_create_vcpu()" as it is
    already merged.
  - To resolve conflicts in new [PATCH v6 3/9] , move the PMU related code
    before the call site of is_tdx_vm().
Changed since v6:
  - Re-base on top of most recent mainline QEMU (staging branch).
  - Add more Reviewed-by from Dapeng and Sandipan.
Changed since v7:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20251111061532.36702-1-dongli.zhang@oracle.com/
  - Re-base on top of most recent mainline QEMU (staging branch).
  - Remove PATCH 1 & 2 from the v6 patchset. Zhao may work on them in
    another patchset.
