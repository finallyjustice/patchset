Subject: [PATCH v5 07/10] target/i386/kvm: query kvm.enable_pmu parameter

When PMU is enabled in QEMU, there is a chance that PMU virtualization is
completely disabled by the KVM module parameter kvm.enable_pmu=N.

The kvm.enable_pmu parameter is introduced since Linux v5.17.
Its permission is 0444. It does not change until a reload of the KVM
module.

Read the kvm.enable_pmu value from the module sysfs to give a chance to
provide more information about vPMU enablement.

Changed since v2:
  - Rework the code flow following Zhao's suggestion.
  - Return error when:
    (*kvm_enable_pmu == 'N' && X86_CPU(cpu)->enable_pmu)
Changed since v3:
  - Re-split the cases into enable_pmu and !enable_pmu, following Zhao's
    suggestion.
  - Rework the commit messages.
  - Bring back global static variable 'kvm_pmu_disabled' from v2.
Changed since v4:
  - Add Reviewed-by from Zhao.
