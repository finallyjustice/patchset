[PATCH UPSTREAM 0/3] target/i386/kvm: fix two svm pmu virtualization bugs

This patchset is to fix two svm pmu virtualization bugs, x86 only.

1. The 1st bug is that "-cpu,-pmu" cannot disable svm pmu virtualization.

To use "-cpu EPYC" or "-cpu host,-pmu" cannot disable the pmu
virtualization. There is still below at the VM linux side ...

[    0.510611] Performance Events: Fam17h+ core perfctr, AMD PMU driver.

... although we expect something like below.

[    0.596381] Performance Events: PMU not available due to virtualization, using software events only.
[    0.600972] NMI watchdog: Perf NMI watchdog permanently disabled

The 1st and 2nd patches has introduced a new x86 only accel/kvm property
"pmu-cap-disabled=true" to disable the pmu virtualization via
KVM_PMU_CAP_DISABLE.


2. The 2nd bug is that un-reclaimed perf events (after QEMU system_reset)
at the KVM side may inject random unwanted/unknown NMIs to the VM.

The svm pmu registers are not reset during QEMU system_reset.

(1). The VM resets (e.g., via QEMU system_reset or VM kdump/kexec) while it
is running "perf top". The pmu registers are not disabled gracefully.

(2). Although the x86_cpu_reset() resets many registers to zero, the
kvm_put_msrs() does not puts AMD pmu registers to KVM side. As a result,
some pmu events are still enabled at the KVM side.

(3). The KVM pmc_speculative_in_use() always returns true so that the events
will not be reclaimed. The kvm_pmc->perf_event is still active.

(4). After the reboot, the VM kernel reports below error:

[    0.092011] Performance Events: Fam17h+ core perfctr, Broken BIOS detected, complain to your hardware vendor.
[    0.092023] [Firmware Bug]: the BIOS has corrupted hw-PMU resources (MSR c0010200 is 530076)

(5). In a worse case, the active kvm_pmc->perf_event is still able to
inject unknown NMIs randomly to the VM kernel.

[...] Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 30 on CPU 0.

The 3rd patch is to fix the issue by resetting AMD pmu registers as well as
Intel registers.

Dongli Zhang (3):
  target/i386/kvm: initialize PMU info only on the first CPU
  target/i386/kvm: introduce 'pmu-cap-disabled' to set KVM_PMU_CAP_DISABLE
  target/i386/kvm: get and put AMD pmu registers

So far we cannot add support to PERFMON_V2 unless the below patch is accepted.
