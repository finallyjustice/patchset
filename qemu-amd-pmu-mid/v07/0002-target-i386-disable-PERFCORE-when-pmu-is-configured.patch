Subject: [PATCH v7 2/9] target/i386: disable PERFCORE when "-pmu" is
 configured

Currently, AMD PMU support isn't determined based on CPUID, that is, the
"-pmu" option does not fully disable KVM AMD PMU virtualization.

To minimize AMD PMU features, remove PERFCORE when "-pmu" is configured.

To completely disable AMD PMU virtualization will be implemented via
KVM_CAP_PMU_CAPABILITY in upcoming patches.

As a reminder, neither CPUID_EXT3_PERFCORE nor
CPUID_8000_0022_EAX_PERFMON_V2 is removed from env->features[] when "-pmu"
is configured. Developers should query whether they are supported via
cpu_x86_cpuid() rather than relying on env->features[] in future patches.

Changed since v2:
  - No need to check "kvm_enabled() && IS_AMD_CPU(env)".
Changed since v4:
  - Add Reviewed-by from Sandipan.
