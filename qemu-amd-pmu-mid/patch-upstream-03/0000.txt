[PATCH 0/5] target/i386/kvm: Fix two AMD PMU virtualization bugs

This patchset addresses two bugs related to AMD PMU virtualization.

1. The first issue is that using -cpu host,-pmu does not disable AMD PMU
virtualization. When using "-cpu EPYC" or "-cpu host,-pmu", AMD PMU
virtualization remains enabled. On the VM's Linux side, you might still
see:

[    0.510611] Performance Events: Fam17h+ core perfctr, AMD PMU driver.

instead of:

[    0.596381] Performance Events: PMU not available due to virtualization, using software events only.
[    0.600972] NMI watchdog: Perf NMI watchdog permanently disabled

To address this, we have introduced a new x86-specific accel/kvm property,
"pmu-cap-disabled=true", which disables PMU virtualization via
KVM_PMU_CAP_DISABLE.

2. The second issue is that unreclaimed performance events (after a QEMU
system_reset) in KVM may cause random, unwanted, or unknown NMIs to be
injected into the VM.

The AMD PMU registers are not reset during QEMU system_reset.

1. If the VM is reset (e.g., via QEMU system_reset or VM kdump/kexec) while
running "perf top", the PMU registers are not disabled properly.

2. Despite x86_cpu_reset() resetting many registers to zero, kvm_put_msrs()
does not handle AMD PMU registers, causing some PMU events to remain
enabled in KVM.

3. The KVM kvm_pmc_speculative_in_use() function consistently returns true,
preventing the reclamation of these events. Consequently, the
kvm_pmc->perf_event remains active.

4. After a reboot, the VM kernel may report the following error:

[    0.092011] Performance Events: Fam17h+ core perfctr, Broken BIOS detected, complain to your hardware vendor.
[    0.092023] [Firmware Bug]: the BIOS has corrupted hw-PMU resources (MSR c0010200 is 530076)

5. In the worst case, the active kvm_pmc->perf_event may inject unknown
NMIs randomly into the VM kernel:

[...] Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 30 on CPU 0.

To resolve these issues, we propose resetting AMD PMU registers during the
VM reset process


Dongli Zhang (5):
  target/i386/kvm: init PMU information only once
  target/i386/kvm: introduce 'pmu-cap-disabled' to set KVM_PMU_CAP_DISABLE
  target/i386/kvm: rename architectural PMU variables
  target/i386/kvm: reset AMD PMU registers during VM reset
  target/i386/kvm: support perfmon-v2 for reset
